            <h1> Moving Supplies List for 2021 and Beyond </h1>
            <p>
              Truth is, there are a few critical questions you should ask yourself before you self-pack. How many boxes do I need to move?
              What kind of boxes will I need? How many delicate items will I need to pack up? The number of questions you need
              answers to before moving can be overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should keep in mind that American Heritage Relocation & Storage can put your mind at ease with our packing and unpacking services. Our household goods motor carriers offer partial and full packing services to help make moving day an
              easy process.
            </p>
            <p>
              you decide to self-pack while moving, we have a full moving supplies checklist for you to use along the way. Follow
              this list and you’re sure to have a smooth move.

            <h3> How Many Boxes Do I Need To Move? </h3>
            <p>
              The first question you need to ask yourself prior to moving is, how many boxes do I need to move? The answer
              is different for everyone depending on how many items a person wants to move, how many heavy or light items a person
              is moving, and how many items a person plans on getting rid of.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here's the deal: every home will need a separate amount of boxes, but on average, a one-bedroom house will likely need anywhere from
              10-45 boxes to keep everything organized and secure. This number may be smaller depending on the size of the house
              or if you live in an apartment. Figuring out how many boxes you need for your move before you start packing up will
              save you time and prevent you from scrambling for more boxes later on.
            </p>

            <h3> How Many Items Do I Need To Move? </h3>
            <p>
              Individual people with a large house will likely have more belongings than those living in a studio. However, regardless
              of the size of your place, it’s better to have more boxes than run out.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you plan on selling or donating belongings before your move, you’ll have fewer items to move. This is important
              to keep in mind for those who are moving to a smaller home. Start decluttering your home at least two months before
              to accurately know how many boxes you’ll need to get moving. Craigslist, local Facebook groups, and garage sales are
              all ideas you can use to sell the items you won’t be packing up
            </p>

            <h2> What Kind of Boxes Do I Need?</h2>
            <p>
              It’s tempting to throw everything into an X-large box and call it a day, but please don’t do that for your belonging’s sake. While throwing all your items into a large box may take little time, you’ll likely end up breaking many of the items in the box, thus forcing you to have to replace them. Instead, opt for a mix of different size boxes.

           <ul>
             <li> <strong>X-large boxes</strong> – These re great for light, bulky items like comforters and clothing. Save yourself some time packing and unpacking by buying a wardrobe box. These are perfect for items you have hanging up, thus making it easier to transfer items from wardrobe to box.  </li>
             <li> <strong>Large boxes </strong> – Large boxes are ideal for bulky items that aren’t as large as comforters. Think pillows, small rugs, purses, and other items that don’t need to be securely fastened into place.
            </li>
             <li> <strong>Medium boxes</strong> – Medium boxes are perfect for most items. We recommend buying a box kit that can secure dishes and other delicate items during your move. </li>
             <li> <strong>Small boxes</strong> – These are best for small bulky items, such as books. While small, heavy items can be stored in medium boxes, it will be much easier to carry them if you portion them out into smaller boxes. </li>

              Boxes are quite important to buy before packing up. But other moving supplies should definitely be on your moving supplies checklist. Remember, it’s better to over-prepare than under-prepare. Plus, you can always return items back that you don’t end up using.
