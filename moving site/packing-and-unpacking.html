            <p>
              Need help packing or unpacking? If you’re getting ready for a big (or small) move, packing is probably one of the
              top stressors in your life right now. School, jobs, or even kids can get in the way of you having time to pack and
              unpack for a move. Don’t continue to dread the moving process; American Heritage Relocation & Storage is proud to share that all of our household goods movers offer both packing and unpacking services.

            <h3> So, do moving companies typically pack for you? </h3>
            <p>
              The answer is a bit mixed. Not all moving companies offer to pack or unpack items, meaning it’s important to check
              with your moving broker beforehand to see if they provide that service.
            </p>
            <p>
              American Heritage Relocation & Storage only partners with Motor Carriers that are happy to help you pack and unpack moving items.
              They’ll make your life easier by helping you pack those last-minute, forgotten items and unload items that you just
              don’t have time to unpack.

            <h3>What To Look For In Packing and Unpacking Services</h3>
            <p>
              Not every moving company can offer you what you need for your move. Understanding what to look for before sealing
              the deal with a moving company can save you broken furniture and a large headache. Before you move, check to see
              that the move coordinators have a packing plan that’s right for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Do the movers offer only packing services or only unpacking services? Will the movers pack up everything for you or
              just partially? Every move is different which means that a moving company should have different plans to suit the
              needs of different customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              At American Heritage Relocation & Storage, we personalize each moving plan for each client. Our movers always make sure to have boxing
              options and proper packing materials ready and on-hand to keep you organized and stress-free.

                    We can do mostly anything moving-related, but we can’t help you figure out what you want to keep and what you
                    don’t. Now, we’re not saying go Marie Kondo and only keep items that bring you joy. But, we are saying that
                    maybe it’s time to donate the sweater that you swore you would start wearing more—three years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A great way to declutter is to figure out when is the last time you’ve used an item and if it’s time to donate
                    it to someone who will get more use out of it. Keep this in mind especially for large, bulky items that can be
                    a pain to pack.

                    f you need help packing or unpacking, we are more than happy to facilitate. However, you won’t be thrilled if
                    the movers pack up the items you need the moment you get to your new place.
                    <strong>
                      Some of the items worth keeping out of boxes being packed by movers include:
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Medications </li>
                    <li> Spare keys </li>
                    <li> Cleaning supplies </li>
                    <li>Essential toiletries </li>
                    <li> A couple, full outfits </li>
                    <li> Important documents </li>
                    <li> Electronic devices and chargers </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Items that are important are worth keeping with you instead of packing them into the moving van. If you need
                    them right away, it can be a hassle waiting for a moving company to unpack all your belongings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for cleaning supplies, you’ll likely need that upon moving everything out. Better to keep the essentials
                    separated from what needs to be packed up over anxiously waiting for them to be revealed later.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>

            <div class="accordion-item wow ">
              <h2 class="accordion-header" id="headingThree">
                <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseThree"
                  aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThree">
                  Plan Ahead
                </button>
              </h2>
              <div id="collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingThree"
                data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">

                  <p>
                    Take the amount of time you think it’s going to take to get completely organized and ready for a move. Now,
                    double that amount of time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It’s quite easy to underestimate the amount of time that it will take to get ready for a move. We recommend
                    starting the process of taking inventory and decluttering at least two months ahead of time. Do you only want
                    partial unpacking and packing services? If so, it could take more time to gather everything you’ll need.

                    Our movers will supply boxes for those who need them. However, it’s a good idea to get boxes and packing
                    supplies beforehand to make the move that much smoother. You’ll likely need a variety of different sized
                    boxes. Small boxes for heavy items like books and larger boxes for soft, bulky items.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Medium boxes are a great option for delicate items such as plates and cups. A pro moving tip is to get bubble
                    wrap and foam to make sure delicate dishware doesn’t shatter. Pack kits also exist to make packing delicate
                    items easier.
