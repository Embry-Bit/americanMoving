            <p>
              Your possessions kept safe and sound involves more than how movers load up their trucks. Those moving to new
              homes or employers moving into new offices should be aware that all of the motor carriers partnered with Executive
              Van Lines offer FREE storage with their moving truck services for 30 days as a courtesy to our customers. We
              wouldn’t be able to call ourselves a full-service moving broker without it.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the most trusted moving broker in America, we here at American Heritage Relocation & Storage make sure that we have everything our
              clients need to make the moving process delightful. Yes, your eyes aren’t deceiving you. Moving can be rewarding and
              even fun with the right storage solutions

            <h3>Will Moving Companies Store Your Stuff? </h3>
            <p>
              Not all moving companies will store your stuff. Many moving companies don’t have the resources available or an idea of how important storage-in-transit is. However, American Heritage Relocation & Storage is happy to offer 30 days of free storage with the moving truck services that we provide.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s stressful thinking about how much money you’ll need to make your move happen. That’s why we offer our storage solutions free of cost for 30 days for those who need them.

            <h3> How Much Does It Cost to Store Furniture with a Moving Company? </h3>
            <p>
              In the United States, it can cost anywhere from $50-$150 a month on average to store furniture with a moving company. This may make those about to relocate consider moving on their own. With Executive Moving & Storage, it pays off to use our storage and moving truck services because the storage is free for 30 days.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s sad to say that many moving companies have hidden fees that their clients are unaware of until it’s time to pay the bill. One of our core values at American Heritage Relocation & Storage is to be completely transparent and honest with our clients. We never surprise our clients with hidden fees. We also always make sure that our clients always understand what they’re paying for before the move. However, our 30-day storage solutions are not something our valued customers have to pay for.

            <h2> Residential Storage Solutions</h2>
             <p>
              In a perfect world, a lease would end right when it’s time to start a new lease. However, most renters know that’s just not the case. Those in this position may choose to store their household belongings during the transition. Alternatively, homeowners may need some storage space while making the transition from one home to a new one. Our residential storage solutions give our customers the time and resources that they need to move without all the chaos.

            <h2> Commercial Storage Solutions </h2>
            <p> No move is too big or too small for American Heritage Relocation & Storage. This includes moving for commercial businesses. Computers along with other office devices can be tricky objects to carefully store without the right equipment and method. Our flexible commercial storage solutions keep electronic devices safe while making an interstate move. </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps you’d like to move office electronics at a later date. That’s an option we can help employers with. Those who need commercial storage solutions can opt to store delicate electronics with our motor carrier while they haul over office furniture. They can pack up and unpack bulky office furniture to make it easier for individuals to move to a new office without a hitch.

      <h2> How To Choose the Right Storage Solutions </h2>
      <div class="r-p">
        <p>
          There are a few factors to consider before committing to a moving company that provides storage. One factor is how much storage space will you need and how much space the moving company can provide. Reputable movers can help you fit your items in a storage space. However, you will need to make sure there is enough space to do so in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, it’s crucial to know whether or not you need a climate-controlled storage option. This is especially important if you need to store items in the long term. Individuals who are about to embark on an interstate move might want to consider this option more than those making a local move. Delicate items like electronics and paper goods will likely need to be stored in a climate-controlled area.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for furniture, certain types must be left in a climate-controlled storage area. Furniture made out of upholstery, wood, or leather could get moldy and rotten without the right storage solution. This is also why it’s important to do the same with clothes of a certain material.
