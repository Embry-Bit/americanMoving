          Factors to Consider When Making an Interstate Move
        </h2>
        <p class="text-center">An interstate move is when individuals move from one state to another. Other names for an interstate move are
          long-distance moves, state-to-state moves, and cross-country moves. Regardless of what someone calls it, there are a few
          factors you must consider before you hire a long-distance moving company.</p>

            <h3>Is the Long Distance Moving Company Legit?</h3>
            <p>
              The owners of American Heritage Relocation & Storage have over 10 years of experience in the moving industry. So we understand what
              makes a quality long-distance moving company. That said, the average person might not.
            </p>
            <p>
              One factor to consider when deciding whether or not to hire a specific moving company is whether or not that moving
              company is federally licensed to move items over state lines. There are strict federal regulations that dictate
              whether or not a moving company has permission to do this.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some unofficial moving companies may forgo these federal regulations, which will likely end in unforeseen problems.
              Don’t stress out though, because we here at American Heritage Relocation & Storage have got you covered. All of our household goods motor carriers can take your important belongings from the East Coast all the way to the West Coast
              and get them there in one piece without cutting any corners.

            <h2> What is Local Moving? </h2>
            <p>A local move is typically a move under 50 miles, although it varies per moving company. Many families may attempt
              to enlist friends to help them move only to find that not a single person is available.</p>
            <p>
              We have some news to tell you: your friends don’t want to help you move! This means that your friends don’t really
              all have emergencies to deal with. They probably just don’t have the heart to tell you that they refuse to help you
              carry your couch down a flight of stairs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep both your friends and your sanity by hiring professional movers for your local move.

            <h2> What is Intrastate Moving? </h2>
            <p> An intrastate move is when an individual moves across city lines within a state. This is different from an
              interstate move, which is between different states. </p>
            <p>
              We don’t want to minimize how difficult an intrastate move can be. That’s why we suggest still taking advantage of
              intrastate moving services. Hiring intrastate moving services lets you cut out all the hard work and focus on what
              matters. That means you can focus on your drive or flight up to your new beginning.

            <p> Each move is unique and needs an individualized approach when it comes to logistics as well as time management. We
              here at American Heritage Relocation & Storage will carefully plan out what is the most appropriate and cost-effective way to have your
              belongings transported to where they need to go in the least amount of time without sacrificing the high-quality
